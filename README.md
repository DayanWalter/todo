# Todo-App

This app is part of the odin-project curriculum.

I will work with html, css and vanilla javascript.

The main goal is to keep everything clean and tidy. - Everything will reside in a module.

First I am going to create the html and style with css.

Then I am going to add functionality with javascript.

This is my second approach of this project. The first one was a mess...

Furthermore I am working with branches and testing different "features" before committing them.
